= In-Browser playground

The `tool/playground.html` file contains an in-browser editor and a Lua VM. By
default LuaSnip is loaded in the `luasnip` global table so you can quickly test
LuaSnip features.

This app is powered by:

- https://lua.org, the official lua VM implementation.
- https://webassembly.org and https://emscripten.org, to compile it for the browser.
- https://ace.c9.io[ACE], a code editor implemented in html5/javascript.
