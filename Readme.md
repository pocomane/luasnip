LuaSnip
-------

LuaSnip is a collection of utility functions for lua. The main features are:

- Simple and short modules
- Each module is contained in a file without dependencies: you can just drop it
in your project and start to use it.
- Single file containing all the documentation and all the code: you can discover LuaSnip modules here, and copy-and-paste code directly.

For a deeper introduction, implementation details and modules reference, you
can continue [here](documentation.adoc).

If you would like to try LuaSnip, there is the online, client-side
[Playground](https://rawgit.com/pocomane/luasnip/master/tool/playground.html)

LuaSnip is strongly ispired by [Lua Zero Dependency
Functions](https://github.com/aiq/luazdf).

All the code is released under the [UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org), as
described in the [COPYING](COPYING.txt) file. It is provided without any
